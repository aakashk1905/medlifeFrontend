Anyone can get piles, but they're more common in people between 50 and 60 years old. While they can be uncomfortable, piles usually aren't serious and can be managed with simple changes and home remedies. To ease symptoms, try increasing fiber in your diet, drinking lots of water, keeping the area clean, using creams or ointments you can buy, and avoiding pushing too hard during bowel movements. If they're severe, Med Life Easy can provide surgical options. At Med Life Easy, we offer various treatments for piles, focusing on simple solutions first and surgery only when necessary.",

When stool reaches the rectum, the sensation of needing to defecate arises. Muscles work collectively to expel stool through the anus. Rectal prolapse occurs when the rectum protrudes outward, often accompanied by stool.The term 'prolapse' denotes the displacement of any organ from its original position. Rectal prolapse is more prevalent in women and typically affects individuals over the age of 50 or those with a history of chronic constipation or diarrhea.",
